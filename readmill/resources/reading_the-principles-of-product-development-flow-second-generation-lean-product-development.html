          <p>An amazing book. I can’t help thinking that this book contains lots of the ingredients to the secret sauce that would make my organisation work much more effectively and successfully. The author states himself that it is lacking in practical implementation detail—this is appropriate as the concepts apply to many different situations—but I would dearly love to read how people have gone about it.</p>

                <p>In general, it is best to delay the project with a low cost of delay. This suggests that we should not prioritize on the basis of project profitability, but rather on how this profitability is affected by delay. Of course, this can only be done when we know the cost of delay, information that 85 percent of developers do not have.</p>

                <p>TOC deserves respect because it has been an extraordinarily useful tool for making people aware of queues. However, the time has come to go a bit deeper. The issue is not queues, it is the economics of queues. Rather than saying queues are universally bad, we must treat them as having a quantifiable cost. This allows us to compare both the benefits and the costs of an intervention to reduce queue size.</p>

                <p>U-curve optimizations do not require precise answers. U-curves have flat bottoms, so missing the exact optimum costs very little. For example, in Figure 2-2, a 10 percent error in optimum batch size results in a 2 to 3 percent increase in total cost. This insensitivity has a very important practical implication.

                <p>let’s say we have nine project teams and nine manufacturing engineers. We could assign a single manufacturing engineer to each team. This would be a good approach if the demand for manufacturing engineering had very low variability. However, if the variability were high, it would be better to operate the nine manufacturing engineers as a single resource pool, combining the variable demand of all nine projects. This would reduce the variability by roughly a factor of three, leading to smaller queues and better response times.</p>

                <p>Figure 7-2 shows how highway throughput behaves as a function of speed. The product of density and speed generates a parabolic curve for highway throughput. This occurs because density decreases linearly with speed. At higher speeds, drivers follow other vehicles at a greater distance to allow sufficient reaction time. This parabolic curve for throughput, originally observed by Bruce Greenshields in 1934, has interesting implications. It shows that throughput is low at both extremes: maximum density and maximum speed. If we wish to maximize throughput, we must operate at the top of the parabola.</p>

In fact, we should be more interested in how ROI is affected by sequence. The total profit of a high ROI project may be less sensitive to a schedule delay than that of a low ROI. In such a case, the low ROI project should go first. Overall portfolio ROI adjusted for delay cost is more important than individual project ROI.</p>
