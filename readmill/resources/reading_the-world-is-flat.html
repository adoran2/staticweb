          <p>I wish I had read the most up-to-date copy of this book. My edition was published in the mid-2000s and it starts out with a narrative on technological innovations that already seems a little outdated. However, the book goes on to explore broader themes of globalisation and offers some good insights and theories into why certain groups prosper and others do not. A worthwhile read.</p>

                        <p>This quote speaks to two things for me: 
1. The inherent danger in how easy it is to choose information sources (i.e. media outlets) that speak to what you want to hear. And this is not always intentional, or even in your control (i.e. targeting online advertising). It is also a chore to listen to people you don&#39;t agree with - and come on, who likes chores?
2. I once heard a take on conspiracy theories that I really liked. The speaker stated that &quot;conspiracy theories undermine democracy.&quot; She went on to explain that in her view, in order to have a democratic society, you need an educated voter base with access to information to make decisions. If this information is incomplete - hidden from view - then it undermines the whole project. If you follow conspiracy theories, then this points to an underlying cynicism, a belief that belies a distrust in those disseminators of information that are themselves vital to a democratic society. 

Then again - could conspiracy theories be considered a sign of a healthy democracy? That people feel comfortable and confident enough (i.e. safe enough) to voice these opinions and question the system?</p>

                        <p>Great stuff! The confirmation bias angle is covered quite well in ‘The Information Diet’ by Clay Johnson that I read some time back. As much as I understand this and know it to be true you will not get me reading news sources such as The Daily Mail as I find them just too abhorrent—tatty, right wing news dressed up as quality reporting. Is it right or wrong for me to avoid them?

Your point on conspiracy theories is really interesting. I think that as long as you are questioning what you are told in terms of who is benefitting from the ‘official’ story or the so-called ‘conspiracy theory’ then you can make up you own mind. A tweet from Jeremy Bowen, a BBC reporter, was the first occasion that I saw someone question who benefitted from the recent chemical attacks in Syria; like a lot of other people on the day I had just assumed it was Assad’s forces and his tweet reminded me to keep an open mind. Having different points of view and weighing up evidence and facts seems democratic to me.

One of the most powerful examples I have seen of both confirmation biases and conspiracy theories is the part in Adam Curtis’ amazing documentary ‘The Power of Nightmares’. He explains about the neoconservatives in the US in the 1970s who were monitoring the Atlantic for sonar pings from Soviet submarines. They didn’t find any pings, and their conclusion was that this was because the Soviets had developed submarine technology that made them undetectable!

                <p>Without taxation, there is no representation. The rulers don&#39;t really have to pay attention to the people or explain how they are spending their money-because they have not raised that money through taxes.
