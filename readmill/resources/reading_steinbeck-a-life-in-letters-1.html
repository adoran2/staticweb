          <p>It is over 10 years since I read the brilliant ‘John Steinbeck, Writer’ by Jackson J Benson and another dip into Steinbeck’s life felt long overdue. This book is a beautiful thing – you get an overwhelming sense of Steinbeck’s humanity and thoughtfulness through his letters. He has an amazing ability to perfectly articulate everything from the grand to the mundane. Sad to finish it.</p>
