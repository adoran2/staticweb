          <p>Brilliant book. I have a feeling that I am going to keep this within easy reach for some time to come and it may end up being one of those rare books that I re-read. Takes agile concepts and makes them practical. I feel like I can now see a way forward as to how we make a start on becoming agile within my department and will be putting this into practice over the next few months.</p>

The question you need to ask is, “What do you do during a project that can be completed within 8 weeks?” You need to identify a group of features to serve as a mini-project within the larger project.</p>

                <p>Acme Media’s team members sit relatively close together at their desks, but for deployments they all go into a conference room and sit at a table face to face. This setup allows the team to tell each other when they’re finished with a step during the deployment. It also accelerates troubleshooting if an issue is encountered.
